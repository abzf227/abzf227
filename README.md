Welcome! My name is Andrew and I am currently a student at Texas A&M studying computer science. Here I will be showcasing personal/professional projects and similar that I created or collaborated with others on. I will quite often be reorganizing my public repositories based on my own progress as a developer, so it's empty, more than likely I am currently working on other projects and I feel my previous are no longer reflective of my current skill level (although I'll probably add them back when I'm finished with the newer ones). Ultimately I hope to showcase a diverse portfolio using many different languages as well as my progress as a programmer!
